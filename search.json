On the y-axis, the frequency tells us the number of survey takers that had the same response. This tells us that people in the “NonHisp White” category had the highest number of people who had ever used cocaine, and there is a common trend across all race categories that the most typical age range when cocaine was first used was between 10 and 30 years old. This result is informative, but it also raised a concern because it made us think that the number of respondents per race category was possibly skewed and led us to question how many survey takers fit into each race category.\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot titled “TOTAL # OF DAYS USED ALCOHOL IN PAST 12 MOS by RACE (Excluding &gt;365 days)” visually represents the distribution of the total number of days alcohol was used in the past 12 months across different racial groups. This visualization is particularly useful for understanding the central tendency, variability, and presence of outliers in the data. In detail, the Asian category shows a slightly lower median compared to others, suggesting a marginally lesser median frequency of alcohol use within this group over the period. Notably, the White category exhibits the largest box, indicating greater variability or dispersion in alcohol use days among individuals in this group. Moreover, in this plot, the Hispanic and Black categories show more outliers on the higher end of the spectrum. This suggests that there are more instances of significantly higher alcohol use days in these groups compared to the typical range observed within the groups.\n\n\n\n \nThis logistic regression model shows many things that can be broken down into understanding. First the intercept used for this model was the Hispanic population and this is due to the dataset being split into Non Hispanic and Hispanic so using the Hispanic population as a baseline was easier for analysis. The coefficient for the intercept/Hispanic population shows that when all other variables are being held constant, the log odds for Hispanic population is -0.70059. This is just in a sense the baseline to compare to the other races. For the Asian population of this dataset, when converting the log odds to odd ratio, the odds of an Asian population smoking cigarettes is 0.6482 times the odds of Hispanics smoking cigarettes. This means that the odds of the Asian population smoking cigarettes is lower than the Hispanic population. This can be seen for any values less than 1 for race categories but we see a change once we get to Non Hispanics that are more than one race where they are greater than 1 odd ratios meaning they have a higher odd ratio of smoking cigarettes compared to Hispanics. The White race group has the highest odd ratio compared to Hispanics and other groups, making them more likely to smoke cigarettes than Hispanic people. In terms of the numbers from the model, White people in the dataset have 1.9676 times the odds of smoking cigarettes compared to Hispanics.\nThis model works and fits for this dataset because the p values for each of the variables of races are lower than 0.05 showing they have significant value. The model also predicts that cigarette use and race groups have a significant relationship based on the amount of stars placed on each row, showing an emphasis on the relationship between the two. It suggests that there are differences in race groups for cigarette smoking trying it for the first time which can be explored further with data either from the outside or other variables that might have relationships with it such as income or geographic location.\nThese are some of the simple relationships we were able to notice upon EDA. Exploring these further is crucial in making key conclusions and hypothesis."

    "text": "To find appropriate data sets that would align with our data, we had to first look into how the location data was collected. The public access data file for the SAMHSA NSDUH 2021 has somewhat limited geographic information, but we have come up with some creative ways to exploit what is there. They provide a variable, “PDEN10”, with information about population density, telling us how many respondents live in a CBSA with 1 million or more people, less than 1 million people, or not in a CBSA, where CBSA stands for “Core-based statistical area”. This variable also uses 2010 census data. To expand upon this variable, we have downloaded data sets from the 2009 CBSA and the 2010 census, which match the data that the original researchers used in the survey. Our plan is to combine the census and CBSA codes, we will divide the census data set by filtering for counties with 1 million and less than 1 million inhabitants, then we will match those with CBSA codes and group/match the survey answers to those counties/CBSA codes. We will group all counties with no CBSA code into an “other” category.\nAnother variable of interest is the “COUNTYP4” column, which describes how many people are in large, small, or non-metro areas. This variable is based on 2013 Rural/Urban continuum codes. We have found that dataset and we will be using it to break down the counties that are classified as large, small, or non-metro to provide further information about which counties and states the respondents of the data set come from. These are the two most general variables concerning location information, but there are others that use the 2010 census data to describe how many people taking the survey live in an American-Indian census block or not. Thus we can also use the 2010 census data set to discover where those areas are to better inform our geographic data.\nThrough such integration, we can establish a more comprehensive, multidimensional dataset, providing a deeper background for our analysis. The selection and integration of these datasets will enable us to explore patterns of drug and substance abuse from various perspectives, gaining a more comprehensive understanding of this issue under the influence of geographical and demographic factors."

    "text": "Process and Next Steps\nWe did not combine the data yet as we are viewing it first individually and then we will combine the data. We do not expect any difficulties with combining it because we can use the RUCC and the CBSA with the census data to get a better understanding of the metro data from the NSDUH data. The process to join the data is to first take the RUCC and associate it with the names of counties in the United States. Then using the CBSA and the census data, we can associate the CBSA with an area in the United States, giving us access to census population which is correlated to the NSDUH calculation of population metric for respondents and where they can be from. This gives us a deeper understanding of where respondents are most likely to be from based off of CBSA and Census data and whether they are from large or small cities based on RUCC as well.\nAlthough we have not yet been able to sufficiently combine the location data sets from the CBSA, RUCC, and Census, our next steps will be to finish cleaning the data sets and then filter the populations by county and likely make a map of the population densities using the geom_sf() tool within ggplot to better show where the survey respondents are located. We will also want to make a table and probably pivot the data to expand the given columns with location/population information to give more information about the possible counties the respondent could come from.\nFor these data sets we would be to combine and then create relationships between drug use and certain large metros that can be correlated with the population of such top metros. This data gives us the best approximation of where respondents may be from and also gives correlations for how these large or small metros and also CBSA codes with the counties census can be seen with drug related problems. We want to take our analysis even further and hopefully use some models that can help give a deeper understanding of what is going on with such respondent info. We also want to explore more relationships between certain variables in the NSDUH dataset and see if we can use such relationships to go even deeper into how location plays a role in affecting such relationships. Exploring this further is crucial in understanding drug and substance abuse."

    "text": "The principles emphasize the importance of considering the impact of data collection, analysis, and dissemination on the communities and individuals being studied. While our data analysis may not directly involve community interaction, we can apply these principles by ensuring that the data we use are collected and analyzed in a way that respects the principles of beneficence, respect for persons, and justice. This includes considering the potential benefits and harms of the data, being transparent about the data’s limitations, and striving for a fair distribution of burdens and benefits.\nSince we are not the ones actually collecting the data, we cannot really consider the principles in relation to that beyond choosing data sets from reputable and ethical sources, but we can think about the principles in their relation to data cleaning, visualization, and analysis. For example, we want to make sure we ask interesting but respectful/considerate questions for our analysis. We also want to make sure, while cleaning the data, that we do eliminate data that is relevant to the groups we are looking at, we do not want to be biased in cleaning our data because we want to keep our analysis representative of the survey participants. Adding on, being able to fairly assess and understand what the data is representing is key to not misinterpret and fall short in analysis. Transparency is key for the audience to understand how the data is being collected and shown so that misinterpretations can be minimized to the best possible degree.\nThe principles of equitable data practice discussed in the article are: beneficence, justice, and respect for persons. When looking at our data set, we have to make sure that there is data available for a diverse range of different demographics. This idea ties into the justice principle because we want to make sure that our data represents multiple perspectives and communities. While our data includes data on income, age, health insurance, and race, it lacks detailed information on the location of the respondents. It would be good to supplement our data with another data set that gives us information about the general location demographics of the participants. Then, beneficence comes in because we want to be aware how sensitive topics can affect certain groups. Since our data concerns substance abuse and mental health disorders, we have to be sensitive when looking at the data and with the questions we decide to ask about it.\nAdhering to the practice of transparency would entail providing clear and comprehensive information about the data, including its limitations and potential sources of bias. It would involve documenting the data collection and analysis processes, making sure the data’s context is well-understood, and acknowledging any potential misinterpretations or misuses of the data. Additionally, the principle of respect for persons would require obtaining informed consent when necessary and protecting the privacy of individuals whose data is used. This helps in maintaining respect amongst individuals for their data collected and also having privacy concerns lowered so that individuals do not fear their data is being used for the wrong purposes.\nIn our analysis, it is possible that due to limited sample size, we were unable to collect a certain amount of data for each race. To address this, we could filter the data set to make sure we are analyzing a comparable amount of data for each race category to make sure we are not biasing the data or producing false data analysis. At the same time, the data itself may have limitations due to the fact that the respondents who can be contacted have similar identities to the investigators. In terms of potential abuse or misuse, if the data is not adequately protected, it could be accessed or used in ways that harm individuals or communities.\nThere might be sampling bias. If the data is not representative of the entire population, conclusions drawn from it might not be generalizable. For instance, certain demographics might be underrepresented or over represented. Moreover, data related to substance use often relies on self-reporting, which can be subject to recall bias and social desirability bias. If not handled carefully, data on substance use can contribute to the stigmatization of individuals who use or have used substances, potentially leading to discrimination or other negative outcomes. Furthermore, Without proper context or understanding, the data can be misinterpreted. For example, high rates of substance use in a particular demographic might be wrongly attributed to cultural or inherent factors rather than socio-economic or environmental reasons. This can further cause divides and lead back to the topic of misinterpretation which hinder from the point that we as a group are trying to convey in our reports and plots."

Do mental health and/or education have a larger effect than any of the previously mentioned factors?\nWe have kept these questions in mind when constructing our thesis.

In the figure legends under each figure, we will briefly describe how the plot was made, why it was made, and what conclusions can be drawn. To keep everything cohesive, we have discussed using theme_minimal() which would keep the data visuals from looking cluttered. We have also carefully thought about the order in which the figures should be included on our website so that anyone reading through it would be able to follow. By this we mean that we want the knowledge gained by each figure to build on each other, starting basic and then building into relationships displaying more complex relationships between variables so that the reader could easily keep track of our thought process and how we have supported our thesis.\nWe also plan to ensure the order in which we present the plots in the analysis page and the big picture page are greatly placed. We are in the process of including relevant images and information for the finished product and making it flow easier from one page to the next. Order is a key aspect which is focused on so that the viewer can understand everything in a manner that isn’t fast paced and well ordered. Wrapping everything up is key in making our project look visually appealing while also displaying the message and thesis to our audience."

    "text": "We have uploaded excel files containing 2010 census information and 2009 CBSA codes, which the original survey makers/data collectors used to process location data information. We are working on merging the two right now to compare them to our existing data set. We have identified the counties/areas that appear both in the Census and CBSA data set. The next goal is to merge the census and CBSA data sets by lining up the information about each overlapping county so that we can get population totals for metro and non-metro areas since that is how location data is categorized in our data set. We know how many respondents come from metro versus non-metro areas, but now we will be able to guess at which counties those individuals come from. It will be interesting, once this is done, to use the geom_sf() function to visualize the spread and density of respondents by US geographical area and then to potentially use this to graph which areas have highest drug or alcohol use.\nWe have also explored multiple drugs and their relations to race and much can be seen about the relationships between the two. We are working on furthering this plot even further to depict the relationship between them better. Working on the Race vs Income predictor using linear regression model is also something we have explored because understanding a key relationship between these two variables help with the thesis and how we can support it and also explore the pitfalls of it. For instance, in the linear regression model, by encoding the race as a categorical variable and setting the income as the dependent variable, we would get the information given from this model. Then we could start model checking for further analysis like addressing Pitfalls. By finding the high correlation between these variables and addressing some issues, we would enhance the validity of our findings. One thing we have noticed about our dataset that limits us is how the survey was set up in that a respondent does not give a number for income but a range which hurts in creating unique values but we are able to make arrangements to go around this issue. We were really interested also in finding out more about how the data was being weighted based on how many people from each race responded to the survey. This is key in understanding more about the survey because it helps determine the representation of this dataset as well which can help with understanding our accuracy for the results given from plots and models.\nWe are looking forward to wrapping the EDA portion of the project by attaining models and plots that really highlight what we are trying to tell to the public about the relationship between race and drug use. Hitting many dead ends as we were doing this project was something we had to overcome because sometimes the questions were skipped by respondents but we were able to find other questions that aligned with what we wanted to use that had more responses. Being able to explain these plots and models is super important and we will use the plots to help showcase and break down the relationships found into elementary parts.\nSome evidence that has already started to present itself is a logistic model created to show cigarette use and race and showing a simple difference between races in how many try cigarettes and use them. Simple models like this can help us go further in understanding whether location play a role in this difference or is it an income difference. Further exploration shows that both do in fact play a role. Whether a person is in a large metro or small metro or rural area is a big factor in what person does in terms of drug related options. Income is also a major factor in what is shown for drug use in that a person with higher income may tend to use more expensive drugs or certain types of drugs and this statement definitely has problems with it as well. Race can be associated with this and the location of whether it is a big city or not is seen to play a role in such a relationship. Being able to plot these relationships effectively is important in letting the general public and those interested in knowing more about this in effectively understanding the relationships."

    "text": "We have uploaded excel files containing 2010 census information and 2009 CBSA codes, which the original survey makers/data collectors used to process location data information. We are working on merging the two right now to compare them to our existing data set. We have identified the counties/areas that appear both in the Census and CBSA data set. The next goal is to merge the census and CBSA data sets by lining up the information about each overlapping county so that we can get population totals for metro and non-metro areas since that is how location data is categorized in our data set. We know how many respondents come from metro versus non-metro areas, but now we will be able to guess at which counties those individuals come from. It will be interesting, once this is done, to use the geom_sf() function to visualize the spread and density of respondents by US geographical area and then to potentially use this to graph which areas have highest drug or alcohol use.\nWe have also explored multiple drugs and their relations to race and much can be seen about the relationships between the two. We are working on furthering this plot even further to depict the relationship between them better. Working on the Race vs Income predictor using linear regression model is also something we have explored because understanding a key relationship between these two variables help with the thesis and how we can support it and also explore the pitfalls of it. For instance, in the linear regression model, by encoding the race as a categorical variable and setting the income as the dependent variable, we would get the information given from this model. Then we could start model checking for further analysis like addressing Pitfalls. By finding the high correlation between these variables and addressing some issues, we would enhance the validity of our findings. One thing we have noticed about our dataset that limits us is how the survey was set up in that a respondent does not give a number for income but a range which hurts in creating unique values but we are able to make arrangements to go around this issue. We were really interested also in finding out more about how the data was being weighted based on how many people from each race responded to the survey. This is key in understanding more about the survey because it helps determine the representation of this dataset as well which can help with understanding our accuracy for the results given from plots and models.\nWe are looking forward to wrapping the EDA portion of the project by attaining models and plots that really highlight what we are trying to tell to the public about the relationship between race and drug use. Hitting many dead ends as we were doing this project was something we had to overcome because sometimes the questions were skipped by respondents but we were able to find other questions that aligned with what we wanted to use that had more responses.

    "text": "Tentative Thesis\nOur tentative thesis is something along the lines of certain races tend to try or use drugs more than other races. Certain cities/rural areas have more or less drug use for certain races. A higher income could have more drug use or low income could have more drug use. We believe a strong and clear thesis from the data analysis we did because it explores important aspects in society that are not presented in the best manner to the public and understanding these differences can help with allocating resources towards those who need help and understanding where drug related problems can occur. Understanding the potential causes can help with addressing such causes as a public or through government. This thesis is still a draft and will be refined more as the EDA wraps up. We plan on making it more refined of a thesis towards the end that fully encompasses our exploration of the data."

    "text": "To approach the data in a way such that we can do efficient cleaning but also have the columns and rows we need to accurately assess the data, we first needed to understand what was recorded from the dataset. Once we understood that we divided and conquered the codebook associated with this data from the SAMHSA. We needed to look at questions answered in the survey such that they had a high response rate and also that they would be able to help in further analysis as well. We are focusing more on cutting many unnecessary columns that would not be as used throughout but also columns that tend to have high no response rates as well. This strategy is effective for the beginning as it gives a very good sense with what we are working with.\nSome of the important columns we needed were which types of drugs people had tried and certain questions like if they have used in the past 30 days. We were also interested in the columns that reported on the age when a person used a substance because we could make an interesting comparison between ages a substance was first used by race. Then we also made sure to include questions about mental health and whether each respondent went out to receive treatment for mental health. This data could allow us to look at relationships between race, mental health treatment, and drug use. Other columns that were important are ones that discuss location as this will relate what we need if we need other datasets to incorporate into it with more precise location . Relating mental health with location as well as drug use to location can help with economic datasets per location be used as well as a follow up to further support the dataset and create more analysis. Another interesting comparison would be to look at the relationship between age of first use of a substance by race to see if there is a good trend/comparison there.\nNot only was this the thinking of our group for the data cleaning strategy, we also quickly realized how important it is to look at certain outliers and data points that might not work for analysis. One of the important points mentioned before was high non response rates which we quickly saw through in the table that we filtered for just cigarettes to understand how much is really missing. The codebook also helps in understanding this as well. This can be quickly seen through a look at the table with all the columns pictured below in the table sample: \nQuickly looking into just this little sample shows that the cigyfu column has a bunch of skipped answers based on the codebook notation as well to support this. The 9999 and 99 and 991 are all variations of “NA” or did not want to respond to the survey to such a particular question as indicated by the codebook. As we continue to go through the data set we will be cautious to check for outliers."

    "text": "We were very invested in taking the route of exploring racial disparity with drug use, income and mental illness and felt these datasets below represent the topic we are interested in very well.\nThe first dataset that we had found was within this link: “https://data.world/balexturner/drug-use-employment-work-absence-income-race-education”.This dataset is called “NSDUH Workforce Adults”. This dataset has 64 columns and 32,040 rows and is taken from the health survey conducted in 2015 by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Since this is a subset selected it is supposed to be randomly selected for optimal analysis. Loading the data was easy as it was a csv easily loaded into R Studio. We have not started cleaning the dataset but we are able to parse through the dataset and get specific columns and data points we might need making it easier for us. The ease of loading it into R Studio and the ability to extract specific columns and data points make this dataset a promising resource for conducting a comprehensive exploration of various socio-economic and health-related factors among adult populations\nThe second dataset that we had found was within this link “https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NACJD/studies/27521/variables”. The dataset is called “Gender, Mental Illness, and Crime in the United States, 2004”. This dataset has 3011 columns and for rows it has more than 2GB of data and the last row is 55,602. The data was collected from a 2004 survey on drug use and health to the public. The data is plentiful with data but however is not up to date with current date and the surveys were major revamped. There are columns that were added to this dataset by the researchers of this dataset. We were able to load the data and get the columns and be able to see some of the sample responses. The only problem with this dataset would be that it may be too old for use but it does contain information that would be useful for relating racial disparity, drug use and justice system.\nThe third dataset that we had found is “https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/dataset/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-2021-nsduh-2021-ds0001”. This dataset is straight from the SAMHSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Services Administration) which conducts surveys directly and collects and asks questions. There is an associated codebook for the data that can help us determine relationships between certain drugs and income and much more as well. Some of the collection methods were web-interviewing and more and cannot be compared at all to previous years according to the website, which offers the most up to date collection. This NSDUH dataset has 2,989 columns and 58,034 entries of rows. It has very big general population coverage in order to analyze. We were able to load the R data into R studio and convert it into a csv as well. Being able to parse the data was also fairly simple which helps in finding relationships between race and medical conditions and more. This is the dataset we are most excited for because of how fairly new it is and how many ways we can go about this topic with this many variables/questions.\nSince we have found three very expansive and diverse data sets, we know that there is a lot of potential for questions we can explore. In our first data set, from the NDSUH codebook linked above, there are several columns of interest to us. This data set covers race, income, and location in relation to drug and alcohol use. Thus we can ask questions such as: what is the link between race and lifetime drug or alcohol use? If we filter by lower income areas, is the link between race and drug/alcohol use stronger? Is income or race a more important influencing factor in drug/alcohol use? These questions can be addressed by the data we have found and we are excited to learn more about how to visualize the data to best address trends in our data. The data set from data.world is also a great option and it has several variables of interest to us. It provides links between drug use, employment rates, work absence, income, race, and education. This would allow us to ask questions such as: Is education level or employment rate by race a stronger influencing factor towards drug use? What is the variance of income by race? What is the average drug use by race and income level and which seems to have more of an influence on drug use? While this data set is interesting and useful, it does not allow us to ask complex questions such as what kind of drugs are more heavily used by different race categories and by different income levels, as the NDSUH codebook data set would allow us to do. The data set from UMich could also be good to use, it has interesting variables such as how many days per week or month people use/buy different drugs and it would allow us to sort the data by race and gender. It is a large data set like the NDSUH one. This data set also includes information on education, income, location, and employment. It would allow us to ask similarly interesting questions.\nWe are very interested in the NDSUH codebook data set, and while it is good that the NDSUH codebook data set is so diverse, this means it is also very large. The size of it has made it hard to work with and load into our repository and this will also make it harder to clean and organize. With the UMich data set, we may struggle to use it because it is not readily available as a CSV file and we would have to convert it into a format we could work with. Because there is so much data in the NDSUH data set, with so many different ways to interpret it and questions to ask, we could potentially struggle to come up with a good question(s) that are easily addressed by the data and not get lost in all of the data we have to work with. We could accidentally choose a question that is too specific and does not capitalize on the breadth of the data set, or we could go too broad and end up with a report that is too complex and does not achieve a meaningful or understandable interpretation of the data. We will also have to work hard to choose what to filter out and how to do that because it is impossible to use the entire data set and we will have to be careful in choosing which parts of it to work with and focus on. It could also be a good idea, with any data set that we choose, to weigh drug use against different factors such as education/income/location when possible so that we can see how much race actually influences drug use so we do not accidentally try to interpret false trends."

For us, we were super excited to explore such a huge dataset such as the NSDUH because we can take our time to explore the small key relationships between so many different variables throughout the dataset. Navigating through such a dataset meant that it took us a long time to find variables that we needed for analysis but it was perfect in the end because we were able to effectively show key relationships that help the general public understand more about certain drugs and their use.\nUltimately our goal is to provide key insights into how certain factors play a role in a person’s drug use even if they tried a drug once.

Features such as metro status in the US so that we can have a baseline understanding of where respondents can be located for drug use is significant in understanding. The same applies for understanding the percentage of respondents because of limitations of this dataset. Setting this background is important for understanding our interpretation.\n\nMaps of How Respondents Are Sorted Across the US According to County Metropolitan Size Status\n\nmetro_map &lt;- counties_cleaned_METRO |&gt; filter(STUSPS != \"AK\", STUSPS != \"HI\", STUSPS != \"MP\", STUSPS != \"AS\", STUSPS != \"PR\", STUSPS != \"GU\", STUSPS != \"VI\") |&gt; \n  ggplot() + geom_sf(aes(fill = metrostatus), alpha = 0.5) + scale_fill_viridis_c() + \n  ggtitle(\"US Counties Colored by Metro Status\") + labs(subtitle = \"1 = Large Metro, 2 = Small Metro, 3 = Non-Metro, 0 = Unkown\", fill = \"Metro Status\") + \n  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 9))\n\nmetro_map\n\n\n\n\nStarting off our analysis, we set the scene with a map representing the types of counties and areas the NSDUH survey respondents are located in. This map was made based on the dataset’s “COUTYP4” variable that sorts the respondents’ locations into three types of counties: large metro, small metro, non-metro, or unknown. As we have made both boxplots and logistic regression models based on the locations and metro county status of the respondents, we were interested in visualizing where these county types are in the USA. This helps set the scene for our further analysis since we can track the regions of the US that these counties are in and we can see how many counties are classified into each type.\n\n\nPercentage of People to Try Drugs Based on Race\nIt’s important to understand not only how many respondents were in this survey but also what percentage of respondents within their respective race have tried any of the 3 drugs mentioned. The reason it is very important to understand the percentage with respect to their race is because in this survey, there was not an equally sized population for each race and some people from a certain race responded more than other people in other races. This can cause representation problems and skews in the dataset so understanding the need for this plot is very important when considering the analysis below.\n\ndrug_use_with_race &lt;- cleaned_data |&gt;\n  select(NEWRACE2, cocever, cocage, crkever, crkage, herever, herage, income, COUTYP4) |&gt;\n  mutate(drug_use = ifelse( cocever==1 | crkever==1 | herever==1, 1, 0))\n\nproportions_table &lt;- drug_use_with_race |&gt;\n  group_by(NEWRACE2) |&gt;\n  summarize(percent_try_drugs = 100*(mean(drug_use)),\n            percent_do_not = 100 - percent_try_drugs) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"percent\"), names_to = \"Drug_Status\", values_to = \"Percentage\")\n\n# Create a bar plot \nggplot(proportions_table, aes(x = NEWRACE2, y = Percentage, fill = Drug_Status)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"stack\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d() +  \n  labs(title = \"Percentage of People Who Tried/Did Not Try One of the Three Drugs by Race\",\n       x = \"Race\",\n       y = \"Percentage\",\n       fill = \"Drug Status\") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, size = 9))\n\n\n\n\nThe plot clearly shows that many people have not tried any of the three drugs but Asians have the lowest percentage of people who tried drugs for their respective race group. Native Americans are the race group with the highest percentage of drugs tried and the White race group is in the middle of the rest of the race groups. Asians, Blacks/African Americans, and Hispanics have the lowest percentage of people within their race group that have not tried any of these drugs. This gives us more insight into how our analysis will play out with our plots and models. We can predict that the model may be more accurate in understanding and predicting drug use based on such a predictor variable.\nKeeping both the metro area and the percentage of people who tried drugs by race for this survey in mind, we have set the scene for how this survey’s information will play out."

    "text": "Plot of Cocaine Use Out of Days per Week by Race Faceted by Metro Status\nFurther in our initial exploratory analysis, we made a boxplot that describes the number of days per week people in each race category use cocaine. The plot is faceted by county metro status to allow for an easy comparison of the weekly cocaine use in each county type. From this plot, we can draw conclusions not only about the counties that use the most cocaine per week, but also the race categories that tend to use the most cocaine. The large metro counties have the highest median weekly cocaine use, while the non-metro counties use cocaine the least on average.\n\nfacet.labs &lt;- c(\"Large Metro\", \"Small Metro\", \"Non-Metro\")\nnames(facet.labs) &lt;- c(\"1\", \"2\", \"3\")\n\ncleaned_data |&gt;\n  filter(ccdaypwk &lt; 85) |&gt;\n  group_by(NEWRACE2) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = NEWRACE2, y = ccdaypwk, fill = NEWRACE2)) + \n  scale_fill_viridis_d() +  \n  geom_boxplot() + \n  facet_wrap(vars(COUTYP4),   labeller = labeller(COUTYP4 = facet.labs), scales = \"free_y\") + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, size = 7)) + \n  labs(title = \"Days per Week of Cocaine Use by Race and County Metro Status\", x = \"Race Category\", y = \"Days Per Week\") + \n  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(size = 9)) \n\n\n\n\nAcross all three county metro classifications, the race group that used the most cocaine per week was the Black/African American group. The other groups had more variety, so it is hard to identify the next highest cocaine using group. The plot explains this variety, however, and we can say that county metro status likely does play a role in weekly cocaine use frequency. This relationship is later supported in our analysis via a logistic regression model. We can see from this box plot that white people in small metro areas tend to use more cocaine than white people in large or non-metro areas. The “more than one race” race category follows this trend as well, with people in that category using more cocaine in small metro areas than in the other two areas. These groups diverge from the other race categories, who trend towards using less and less cocaine going from large to non-metro areas. These observations raise several interesting questions concerning the average income by race, the general access to, and interest in cocaine in each of these counties, which would be interesting to analyze further in a future study."

Asian and Black/African American race groups seem to try crack later in their lives compared to other race groups on average. The spread for White and Black/African American race groups seem to be the highest out of all the other race groups as well. Hispanic, Native American, and Native Pacific Island race groups have a tighter spread compared to the others. All the race groups first try crack on average around the late teens to early 20s range if they were to use.\n\n\nFirst Age Used Heroine By Race Plot\n\nher_data &lt;- drug_race_age |&gt;\n  filter(herage &lt; 86)\n\nggplot(her_data, aes(x = NEWRACE2, y = herage, fill = NEWRACE2)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d() + \n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Age of First Drug Use of Heroine by Race\",\n       x = \"Race\",\n       y = \"Age of First Use\",\n       fill = \"Race Type\") +   \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) \n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot above for age of first time heroine use indicates key differences between many of the race groups. The white race group has the most variability compared to the other race groups which would be interesting to explore what is causing people in the white race group to try heroine later in their lives. The average age seems to vary between the race groups compared to crack which is something that can be explored very early on. Something interesting that comes up is that on average the Native Pacific Island groups try heroine when they are around 10 years old which is super interesting to go into.\nThis gives us insight that these race groups have differences between one another that can be explored further with what might be affecting the age that people try crack or heroine, whether its income, location or anything else."

    "title": "Analysis",
    "section": "Logistic Regression Models",
    "text": "Logistic Regression Models\n\nSetting Background and Understanding Choice\nSeveral models were created and then assessed for their usefulness and quality. We tried several different predictors in these models to inform how location or income factor, along with race, into a person’s tendency to use drugs. Out of five original models, we took a few things into consideration when deciding which to keep, such as looking at how many values in the model were significant based on their p-values. Many of the models were great, and had similar amounts of significant values, so to narrow down our selection we then looked at the AIC of each model and compared them. A smaller AIC implies a higher quality model. Overall, the AIC values between each model did not vary too much, so we were also able to simply choose models based on which provided the most interesting results to discuss and to support our thesis.\nImportant to note that the baselines/intercepts are the Asian Population for the other variables to baseline and compare to. The reason we chose Asian race group to be the baseline because they had the lower percentage of people doing these 3 drugs so it would be easier to compare the rest to them.We are gonna assume for the model here that the hypothesis is that there is no association between likelihood of trying drugs ever and race group as well as income. To understand what factor(income)1,2,3 or 4, the following is their associated values in the survey: 1:Less than 20,000, 2: 20,000 - 49,999, 3: 50,000 - 74,999, 4: 75,000 or More. These numbers are for American Dollars as well. To understand what factor(COUTYP4)1,2,3 is the following key is important: 1: Non-Metro, 2: Small-Metro, 3: Large-Metro.\n\n\nSubstance Use with Race\nThe first model to be explored is whether Race alone is a significant enough of a predictor alone to predict drug use of the three drugs.\n\n# Model for the Substance Use vs Race \nmodel_sub &lt;- glm(drug_use ~ NEWRACE2, data = drug_use_with_race, family = \"binomial\")\n\ntidy_output &lt;- tidy(model_sub)|&gt;\n  mutate(term = ifelse(term == \"(Intercept)\", \"Asian\", str_replace(term, \"NEWRACE2\", \"\")))\n\nconf_intervals &lt;- confint(model_sub)\n\nodds_ratios &lt;- exp(coef(model_sub))\n\nodds_ratios_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  Odds_Ratio = odds_ratios\n)\n\noutput_table &lt;- cbind(tidy_output, conf_intervals,odds_ratios_df) |&gt;\n  rename(Race = term) |&gt;\n  select(-statistic,-std.error) |&gt;\n  rownames_to_column(var = \"RowNames\") |&gt;\n  select(-RowNames)\n\noutput &lt;- output_table |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt;\n  as_raw_html()\n\noutput\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Race\n      estimate\n      p.value\n      2.5 %\n      97.5 %\n      Odds_Ratio\n    \n  \n  \n    Asian\n-3.1570003\n1.607882e-276\n-3.33597906\n-2.9873274\n0.0425532\n    Black/Afr Am\n0.3826770\n1.985242e-04\n0.18399190\n0.5875426\n1.4662043\n    Hispanic\n0.8475271\n7.009859e-19\n0.66410931\n1.0388306\n2.3338682\n    More than one race\n1.4421499\n3.563612e-43\n1.23974313\n1.6505018\n4.2297798\n    Native Am/AK Native\n1.7557324\n7.517128e-38\n1.48742734\n2.0231721\n5.7876851\n    Native HI/Other Pac Isl\n0.6478794\n1.539770e-02\n0.09005425\n1.1447060\n1.9114830\n    White\n1.3642680\n1.009680e-51\n1.19188561\n1.5456820\n3.9128579\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nBased on the results of the model, we can see a couple of things. First being that all the races have a significantly statistical value for the p value which is very important to note. There is also the coefficient estimates for race variables, which indicates that the Asian race (-3.1570003) is the baseline for the other races to be compared too. Black/African American race group has a odds ratio of 1.4662043 indicating that it is positive and thus tend to be associated with drug use that is higher than that of the Asian race group which is used as the baseline. A positive odds ratio is seen for all the race groups. The p-values as mentioned earlier are all significant and therefore this model lets us say that we have race group as a significant predictor for finding whether the person used drugs or not.\n\n\nSubstance Use with Race and Income\nThe second model to be explored is whether Race and Income is a significant enough of predictors to predict drug use of the three drugs. The predictors Race and Income do not effect each other in this model.\n\n# Model for the Substance Use vs Race and Income\nmodel_sub_income &lt;- glm(drug_use ~ NEWRACE2+factor(income) , data = drug_use_with_race, family = \"binomial\")\n\ntidy_output_income &lt;- tidy(model_sub_income)|&gt;\n  mutate(term = ifelse(term == \"(Intercept)\", \"Asian\", str_replace(term, \"NEWRACE2\", \"\")))\n\nconf_intervals_income &lt;- confint(model_sub_income)\n\nodds_ratios_income &lt;- exp(coef(model_sub_income))\n\noutput_table &lt;- cbind(tidy_output_income,conf_intervals_income, odds_ratios_income) |&gt;\n  select(-statistic,-std.error) |&gt;\n  rownames_to_column(var = \"RowNames\") |&gt;\n  select(-RowNames)\n\noutput &lt;- output_table |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt;\n  as_raw_html()\n\noutput\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      term\n      estimate\n      p.value\n      2.5 %\n      97.5 %\n      odds_ratios_income\n    \n  \n  \n    Asian\n-2.7946504\n2.276345e-198\n-2.98139836\n-2.61646366\n0.06113625\n    Black/Afr Am\n0.2105165\n4.181298e-02\n0.01064725\n0.41648856\n1.23431537\n    Hispanic\n0.7197185\n6.213811e-14\n0.53543831\n0.91180955\n2.05385493\n    More than one race\n1.3615481\n1.768122e-38\n1.15858039\n1.57042338\n3.90222958\n    Native Am/AK Native\n1.5842020\n7.567033e-31\n1.31459364\n1.85293690\n4.87539938\n    Native HI/Other Pac Isl\n0.5303637\n4.775532e-02\n-0.02836787\n1.02832625\n1.69955026\n    White\n1.3431709\n4.792362e-50\n1.17050668\n1.52483885\n3.83117242\n    factor(income)2\n-0.1451897\n1.246171e-04\n-0.21924758\n-0.07090314\n0.86485825\n    factor(income)3\n-0.3215810\n5.673575e-13\n-0.40916886\n-0.23426807\n0.72500194\n    factor(income)4\n-0.5685421\n1.175517e-52\n-0.64137063\n-0.49542948\n0.56635054\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nThis statistical output for this logistic regression model contains some important information for the income and race vs drug. The coefficient estimates for race variables, which indicates that the Asian race (-2.7946504) have the lower odds of the outcome compared to the baseline race, and the odds ratio (0.06113625) shows that about 6.1% of the baseline group’s odds, after controlling for other factors in the model. The other races, all with the positive coefficient and odds ratio, suggest that a higher odds of drug use. In this case, the Native Am/AK Native group contains the highest coefficient (1.584202) as well as the odds ratio (4.87539938), which is significantly higher drug use. For the income factors contains the negative coefficient and odds ration less than 1, suggesting a trend of lower drug use with higher income levels. From the section of the p values, with all below 0.05 indicating the associations are statistically significant. Furthermore, the output of the 95% confidence intervals, the result of the Native HI/Other Pac Isl is slightly cross the line of no difference while the others are not crossing 1, also indicate the significance. In general, this model has identified meaningful predictors for the outcome variable. We can assume based of this that income plays a role in predicting drug use as well.\n\n\nSubstance Use with Race and Location as a Factor of Each Other\nThe third model to be explored is whether Race and Location is a significant enough of predictors to predict drug use of the three drugs. The predictors Race and Location do not effect each other in this model.\n\n# Model for the Substance Use vs Race and Location\nmodel_sub_loc &lt;- glm(drug_use ~ NEWRACE2*factor(COUTYP4), data = drug_use_with_race, family = \"binomial\")\n\ntidy_output_loc &lt;- tidy(model_sub_loc)|&gt;\n  mutate(term = ifelse(term == \"(Intercept)\", \"Asian\", str_replace(term, \"NEWRACE2\", \"\")))\n\nconf_intervals_loc &lt;- confint(model_sub_loc)\n\nodds_ratios_loc &lt;- exp(coef(model_sub_loc))\n\noutput_table &lt;- cbind(tidy_output_loc,conf_intervals_loc, odds_ratios_loc) |&gt;\n  select(-statistic,-std.error) |&gt;\n  rownames_to_column(var = \"RowNames\") |&gt;\n  select(-RowNames)\n\noutput &lt;- output_table |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt;\n  as_raw_html()\n\noutput\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      term\n      estimate\n      p.value\n      2.5 %\n      97.5 %\n      odds_ratios_loc\n    \n  \n  \n    Asian\n-3.29911262\n1.511924e-182\n-3.53178381\n-3.08208396\n0.03691591\n    Black/Afr Am\n0.61102435\n4.760341e-06\n0.35385010\n0.87831283\n1.84231761\n    Hispanic\n0.83333553\n2.198964e-11\n0.59525331\n1.08425648\n2.30098095\n    More than one race\n1.48493068\n1.292379e-24\n1.20377051\n1.77311651\n4.41465940\n    Native Am/AK Native\n1.49630331\n6.815031e-07\n0.87212463\n2.06114079\n4.46515225\n    Native HI/Other Pac Isl\n0.88617947\n4.460820e-02\n-0.08562546\n1.67434874\n2.42584391\n    White\n1.60089845\n1.308959e-42\n1.37861363\n1.83814473\n4.95748447\n    factor(COUTYP4)2\n0.30815363\n1.144636e-01\n-0.08248858\n0.68510688\n1.36091006\n    factor(COUTYP4)3\n0.86072598\n1.009940e-02\n0.15211644\n1.47623530\n2.36487693\n    Black/Afr Am:factor(COUTYP4)2\n-0.35741823\n1.117201e-01\n-0.79395489\n0.08866170\n0.69947989\n    Hispanic:factor(COUTYP4)2\n0.04987982\n8.115547e-01\n-0.35523202\n0.46682696\n1.05114476\n    More than one race:factor(COUTYP4)2\n-0.16604083\n4.718816e-01\n-0.61417091\n0.29212325\n0.84701165\n    Native Am/AK Native:factor(COUTYP4)2\n0.05429409\n8.885588e-01\n-0.69073536\n0.83392870\n1.05579505\n    Native HI/Other Pac Isl:factor(COUTYP4)2\n-0.53427781\n3.815287e-01\n-1.73835433\n0.69714658\n0.58609240\n    White:factor(COUTYP4)2\n-0.44699631\n2.412319e-02\n-0.82995924\n-0.05074942\n0.63954627\n    Black/Afr Am:factor(COUTYP4)3\n-1.51515647\n9.166101e-05\n-2.25014127\n-0.71913572\n0.21977379\n    Hispanic:factor(COUTYP4)3\n-0.55597043\n1.165636e-01\n-1.21518503\n0.18552519\n0.57351544\n    More than one race:factor(COUTYP4)3\n-0.63963282\n8.298436e-02\n-1.33067981\n0.12703342\n0.52748607\n    Native Am/AK Native:factor(COUTYP4)3\n-0.31287504\n4.941302e-01\n-1.17617033\n0.62527972\n0.73134130\n    Native HI/Other Pac Isl:factor(COUTYP4)3\n-0.84568811\n2.610900e-01\n-2.38449634\n0.62667752\n0.42926188\n    White:factor(COUTYP4)3\n-1.04849307\n1.875882e-03\n-1.66980929\n-0.33549596\n0.35046548\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nThis last model also quite interesting relationships between race, location to drug use. As spoken about earlier, the race predictor variable is very good at predicting drug use but when taking into account location, things change a bit. This model takes into account when race and location are factored together. The model shows p values for all the races and the locations and that locations seems to be not statistically significant but close for a Small-Metro area and significant for Non-Metro areas for predicting drug use. When the two are shown together, there are many that have small p-values but not small enough for the 0.05 threshold to be significant. However some variables such as White and Non metro showed a significant p-value and estimates that indicate they were less likely to do drugs than the baseline, which includes Asians and Large Metro. It showed that locations with less people like Non-Metros can be seen to be associated with lower drug use compared to the baseline. In total however, this model is very good at showing that it is not enough to simply put location coded by Large Metro, Small Metro and No Metro and Race together as they seem to have mixed relationships but the p-values are small enough that if we were to have more data available we could make a more defined claim. Therefore, Location and Race are good predictors that have room for improvement."

    "text": "Conclusion\nWith our study, we aimed to investigate the factors that influence cocaine, crack, and heroin use in the USA. We were successful in uncovering relationships between substance abuse, location, income, and age. We found that on average, people try crack at a younger age than they try heroin. In terms of income, we found, via logistic regression, that people with a lower annual income tend to use more drugs than those with higher incomes, a trend that was consistent across most racial groups. For the location relation, we saw via logistic regression and boxplots that people in large metro areas use the most drugs on average, but this trend was not consistent across all race categories. We found that white people and people of more than one race in small metro areas use more drugs than people of the same race categories in other areas.\nOur study has provided valuable insight into the influence of a variety of demographics on drug use. Cocaine, crack, and heroin are very dangerous drugs and understanding why a person may be more or less inclined to use them is vital in addressing the issues with drug use in the US. We believe that this study would be an excellent support for a future complementary study that dives further into how the factors we have investigated come to affect drug use. We would be interested in further studying how the factors we have identified affect someone’s access to these drugs as the access to drugs is a variable not covered in this survey."

    "text": "Limitations of Analysis\nWhile our analysis has provided significant findings and we have shown via statistical modeling that there is strong correlation between our variables of interest, there are some flaws and limitations to consider when assessing the results of our study. First, the survey asks the respondent to report on their drug use, race, location, age, and more. Their responses to questions concerning the latter variables need not be taken into question. However, their responses to questions concerning their drug use should be taken with a grain of salt because their responses are based on their memory. This means that they may falsely report on their drug use history which introduces error into our findings. Another limitation we must take into account are the percentages of the number of respondents from each race to the total number of survey respondents. More respondents come from the white race category than from any other race category, so this introduces skew into our results. For example, if we simply said “more white people use cocaine than any other race category”, this may or may not be true because more white people responded to the survey than any people of any other race. To address and minimize this location, we created a plot that uses population percentages in an analysis of drug use frequency. See the section “Percentages of People to Try Drugs Based on Race”."

    "text": "Need for Further Analysis\nBased on the boxplots that compare the ages when people first tried crack versus heroin, a data analysis concerning the accessibility of crack versus heroine to younger people would be an interesting complementary study to further investigate the trend of people trying crack at a younger age than cocaine. This study could look at how people acquire crack versus cocaine, the median cost of either drug, the average interest of younger versus older people in using crack or cocaine, and the access of those groups to mental health resources between the ages of 18 to 30, which are the approximate median ages of first use of crack and heroine, respectively. We would also be interested in exploring what percentage of their annual income people spend on drugs and how race, location, age, and access to mental health resources may factor into that spending. We also believe that we could understand, specifically the location portion of this survey, better, if we knew more about how people gained access to each of these drugs. Knowing the volume of drug dealers or other sources of drug access in each county, or even just in each state, would be great supporting knowledge to our study.\nWe can also expand the analysis to include data on specific location which is made private by SAMHSA for the NSDUH to understand which areas may be more prone to drug use than other areas for people. Another way to go even further is to specify the income amount to the dollar if possible and not ranges so we can apply linear regression models to get an even better sense of what is going on with drug use factors. We can even go further to include even more factors such as family history, mental health, etc. These all would add significant detail and explore new relationships that can be talked about further in other research."

    "text": "There are many stereotypes about the relationships between race, annual income, location and age for drug use. What underlies common perceptions linking race, income, and drug use? With this study, we have explored connections and factors towards drug use and will tell you everything you need to know about how race, income, location and age actually influence drug use across the US. The results of our study are based on the National Survey on Drug Use and Health which was conducted in 2021. This survey asked people to report on their drug use, including information about the age when they first used a substance, how often they use it, and how likely they are to use it again in the future. The survey also collected information about the survey taker’s race, income, and location based on county size of where they are located.\nThe survey data is very comprehensive, but to focus on the results of our study, we have only looked at factors influencing the use of three substances: heroin, cocaine, and crack. Stereotypes often heard about these substances would be, for example: people with higher yearly incomes tend to use more cocaine, and people with lower yearly incomes would be more prone to using heroin or crack. We wanted to validate and potentially debunk these stereotypes via statistical models and tests that would test the data-based relationships between drug use, race, and income. For more details on those tests and models, please see the Analysis tab of our website.\n\n\n\n\nAfter we had conducted our analysis, we found that there is a clear relationship between race and drug use. Some noteable things to notice first are people who tried drugs and did not based on their race.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart indicates varying drug usage patterns among ethnic groups, with Native Americans/Alaska Natives having the highest percentage of people who have tried drugs, while Asians show the lowest. We can see such a huge differences between many of these race groups which is super important in finding variables that can be contributing to such differences. Although for all the race groups the majority have never tried one of these three drugs, its important to explore the reason the others have tried such drugs and what could be causing people to try them. Could this be attributed to income differences or where someone might live? Well the answers might surprise you!\n\n\n\n\n\nTo provide context for the average frequencies of the summer use of cocaine, crack, and heroin across the racial groups we have studied, we made a bar chart that shows the average number of days per week each group used any of the three drugs of interest. From this plot, we found that the Non-Hispanic Black/African American group used these drugs the most frequently, while the Non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander group used them the least. This plot is a good basis for what we will expand on further in our data analysis since it gives us the preliminary knowledge of which race groups are using the most drugs on average, and which are using the least. This sets up the relationship between race and drug use that we are interested in investigating with this study.\n\n\n\nThe intersection of race and income revealed some unexpected trends in the propensity for drug use. The commonly held belief that higher-income individuals are more likely to indulge in drug use, particularly with expensive drugs like cocaine, was partly substantiated. However, this trend was not uniform across all racial groups. Lower-income individuals across most racial groups exhibited a higher likelihood of drug use, contradicting the notion that drug use is a luxury afforded only by the wealthy. For instance, among higher-income brackets, White and Asian populations showed a relatively lower frequency of drug use compared to their Black and Hispanic counterparts. This divergence suggests that income alone does not dictate drug use patterns; cultural, social, and possibly even genetic factors play significant roles.\n\nWe also found that there are relationships between income and drug use. Generally speaking, drugs, especially heroin or cocaine, are extremely expensive. So income is one of the important predictors that we need to consider. This perception may suggest that individuals with higher incomes could have more access to such substances due to their ability to afford them. Since the dependent variable that we apply (drug use), which outcome is binary, we utilized the logistic regression model for analyzing. By including and combining the ‘NEWRACE2’ and ‘income’, we were able to explore how these variables together can influence the drug use pattern. From the output table, the ‘Asian’ racial tends to have a lower odds of drug use while the native American is the highest. However, there are some interesting findings of the income levels. The data of the odds ratio indicates that with lower income levels showing a higher drug use. This is an unexpected result from the perceptions. In this case, the factors like socio-economic or psychological are what we need to consider. Isn’t that interesting? It is important to explore income and its effect on drug use because it gives more insight into how income problems or surplus in income can lead to a person’s decision in picking up serious drugs such as cocaine, crack and heroine.\n\n\n\n We were also interested in the relationship between location and drug use. We wanted to address the stereotypes that involve substance use and location. There are stereotypes such as “people in large cities/metropolitan areas tend to use more drugs like cocaine than people in rural counties”. We found that this is a claim that the NSDUH data supports. We found that more people use, on average, cocaine more days per week in large metro areas than those in small metro and non-metro areas. It was also found that more race categories use cocaine in a week in those large metro areas than those in non-large metro areas, with the Black/African American race category having the highest median number of days per week of use across all three metro classifications.\nThis could be due to the fact it might be easier in large metro areas to get a hold on these very dangerous drugs. There are many possibilities that could be explored as to why this relationship is evident but having these relationships shown by data is quite extraordinary.\n\n\n\nWe found some interesting trends between age and drug use as well. We have shown that on average, people try crack at a younger age then they try heroin. This could be due to a variety of factors, and interesting follow-up studies could involve access to those drugs and a survey of the average interest of people of a variety of ages in either drug. We would hypothesize that there is higher accessibility of crack to younger people, but that it is more difficult to acquire heroin.\nOur analysis of the 2021 National Survey on Drug Use and Health has presented a nuanced understanding of the intricate web of factors influencing the use of cocaine, crack, and heroin in the United States. By exploring the variables in this survey, we have offered insights that could guide effective policy and intervention strategies. To address issues with drug use, we need to know more about why they are tried in the first place. By sorting through the variables in the survey, it has become evident that drug use is not a monolithic issue but a complex interplay of race, income, location, and age. This understanding is crucial for developing targeted and effective approaches to address the challenges of drug abuse in various communities. Our study serves as a stepping stone for further research and discussion, aiming to contribute meaningfully to the ongoing efforts to combat substance abuse.\n\n\n\nThis link we have is a link to a presentation we have talking about our analysis here: https://youtu.be/CoQWSLZuXDg"

    "text": "We found the data set by googling keywords such as “mental health, race, age, substance abuse” accompanied with “data set, csv, R”. This allowed us to find the codebook from the “Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration”, describing a survey on substance abuse, mental health, and race from 2021. This survey was the “National Survey on Drug Use and Health”. We deemed this source reputable and we found an R file to download from: https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/dataset/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-2021-nsduh-2021-ds0001. The link to the codebook is here:\nhttps://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/field-uploads-protected/studies/NSDUH-2021/NSDUH-2021-datasets/NSDUH-2021-DS0001/NSDUH-2021-DS0001-info/NSDUH-2021-DS0001-info-codebook.pdf.\n The survey was conducted by SAMSHA - Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration which is a government agency for the United States of America.\nAnother dataset we found that we needed was the Census data for 2020 and getting the counties with their respective population count. This was important to to plot the counties onto a map of America so to show which cities are clustered with people more and associate it with the survey of which areas are considered large, small, or non metro areas. There are many variables that are collected by the Bureau but the most important ones that are relevant to the main dataset is the county names to get each county and the population size of each county such that it can be plotted onto the map of the United States as a heatmap of population density. The link to the US Census data for 2020 is https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/decade/2020/2020-census-results.html.\n\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this data and the NSDUH organization was to measure the frequency and relationship between substance abuse and mental health issues. The target population is the civilian and noninstitutionalized one. This survey was sent out to and filled out by individual persons in the USA, aged 12 and over, the data was collected cross-sectionally. The survey collectors warn that this data is dependent on respondent’s truthfulness and memory, and should thus be taken with a grain of salt. Also, this survey does not include data from citizens who are active-duty military members or living in institutional group shelters (homeless shelters, hospitals, prisons, etc.). They warn that this may underestimate the use of certain drugs like heroin.\nFor the creation of the census, it was created by the United States Census Bureau Agency. It is done every 10 years and is a way to produce data on the American people and the economy of the United States as well. The hope in doing this is that the United States gets a better sense of how the American people are doing and where many people are located and understanding more about what kinds of decisions need to be made for the people or society. The census is conducted through electronic questionnaires to business, homes and many other places where someone may be. Sometimes they will sample people and conduct in person interviews as well but it is not possible to do it for every single person in America so relying on electronic questionnaires and other forms of filling the census are essential in the Bereau’s methods of collection.\n\n\n\nWhile we used the R file available to download to make the cleaned data set in our final project repository, we used the codebook to actually understand the data set R dataset file. The codebook contained information about each column and it was broken down into sections of self-administered substance abuse, imputed substance abuse, other self-administered sections, demographics, and geographic. We divided the sections and went through them, when sorting through the substance abuse sections, we stayed consistent in the types of columns we chose, those were: “age when first used”, “time since last used”, “number of days per week used in last 12 months”, and “best estimate of how many times used in last 30 days”.\nWhile the data set we are using from the 2021 NSDUH contains bountiful information concerning substance use, race, income, mental health, education, and age, it does not include very specific location information. The main information provided about the location of the survey respondents is stored in the variables “PDEN10” and “COUTYP4”. The PDEN10 variable represents “Population Density 2010” and respondents are sorted into coming from county based statistical areas (CBSAs) of 1 million or more people, less than 1 million people, or as not in a CBSA. The NSDUH survey designers created those classifications based on 2013 CBSA codes and 2010 Census data. They used the Census data to obtain the population counts for the different CBSA or non-CBSA areas. Although it was not available by the survey makers at the time, we decided to use 2020 Census data to provide a more up-to-date visualization of the populations of the three categories of the PDEN10 variable. This more closely reflects the county statuses at the time the survey data was collected in 2021. The COUNTYP4 variable sorts respondents based on rural urban continuum codes (RUCC) from 2013. It places respondents into large metro, small metro, or non-metro counties. To visualize these counties on a US map, we downloaded and cleaned an excel data file of the 2013 RUCC.\n\n\n\nThis is the link to the script, cleaning script. The Script cleans the data by keeping only the columns that have enough responses to the questions and also are highly relevant questions that can be used in understanding the data. Our strategy is too use the columns with the most value in analysis. Questions like “Have you ever smoked a cigarette” have high response rates and gives key insight into how we can associate drug/substance use with what we are trying to look into. The script filtering involved taking all the questions we deemed qualified to be included in and the rest of the 2,800 variables in this dataset to be filtered out and to keep a consistent set of questions for the analysis use. Such selecting looks like:\ndrug_health_data_clean_new &lt;- PUF2021_100622 |&gt;\n  select(QUESTID2, filedate,\n         cigever, cigage, mjever, mjage, alcever, cocever, cocage, crkever, crkage, herever, herage, UD5ILLANY, ... (other variables)\nThen we save the dataframe into a rds file for storage purposes and continue to the other datasets.\nFor the location analysis portion of our project, we used data from the 2020 Census, the 2009 CBSA, and the 2013 Rural Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC). To clean the CBSA data set, the readxl package was used to read the CBSA excel file. The data was already pretty clean, but in the original file there was a blank row and a few header rows, so we had to make sure to skip those. Then the column names were labeled and any missing values were converted to read as NA. A similar procedure was followed to read in an excel file containing Census data. With the Census data, we were interested in county populations by state.\nOne thing we had to consider with the Census data was that it contained a row at the start of each state where the county name and the state name were the same and this row listed the state’s total population. While we did not remove this row when cleaning the data set, we were aware of it and would filter it out if necessary. For example, it was not necessary to filter out this row when we created a merged CBSA/CENSUS dataset since we joined the datasets on the conditions that a pair of state and county names matched in both datasets and since the CBSA data did not have any such pairs, it would automatically be eliminated. This merged dataset would provide insight into the “PDEN10”, or Population Density 2010, variable, but we did not end up exploring that much further because we became more interested in how the metropolitan status of a county was related to drug use and this insight was provided by combining Census, CBSA, and RUCC data.\nWe ended up using the merged Census/CBSA data to find overlap between the Census and RUCC counties not only to stay true to the techniques of the survey designers, but also because the CBSA data provided FIPS codes of counties in the Census, and in the RUCC dataset counties were identified by their FIPS codes so this made the overlap easy. We then used this 3-way merged data set to create the map visualizing county metro status in the US.\nWe also had to download and use the ‘tigris’ package to make this map because we needed the shape files/geometries of the counties of interest. Tigris is an R package that grants you access to the shape files of counties or states based on US Census data. We took advantage of the counties() function within tigris to pull county geometries and then combined them with lists of large, small, and non-metro counties we had made based on the Census, CBSA, and RUCC data sets. With that information, we were able to make a US map that shaded the US counties by metro status.\nOne important thing that we had to look into when cleaning the CBSA, CENSUS, and RUCC data sets was the column types since they were all excel files. We tried using the character() function to tell us the types of columns we were dealing with to pass into the read_excel() function. However, we still ran into parsing errors because the excel files had numeric values stored as texts. To address this issue, we used a feature of read_excel() that allowed us to pass in a column type called “guess”, allowing R to guess at/decide on how it wanted to read in the numeric values stored as text which fixed the error message and produced readable data. Once this error had been fixed, we were able to save the cleaned CBSA, Census, and RUCC data sets as RDS files."

The link to the US Census data for 2020 is https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/decade/2020/2020-census-results.html.\n\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this data and the NSDUH organization was to measure the frequency and relationship between substance abuse and mental health issues. The target population is the civilian and noninstitutionalized one. This survey was sent out to and filled out by individual persons in the USA, aged 12 and over, the data was collected cross-sectionally. The survey collectors warn that this data is dependent on respondent’s truthfulness and memory, and should thus be taken with a grain of salt. Also, this survey does not include data from citizens who are active-duty military members or living in institutional group shelters (homeless shelters, hospitals, prisons, etc.). They warn that this may underestimate the use of certain drugs like heroin.\nFor the creation of the census, it was created by the United States Census Bureau Agency. It is done every 10 years and is a way to produce data on the American people and the economy of the United States as well. The hope in doing this is that the United States gets a better sense of how the American people are doing and where many people are located and understanding more about what kinds of decisions need to be made for the people or society. The census is conducted through electronic questionnaires to business, homes and many other places where someone may be. Sometimes they will sample people and conduct in person interviews as well but it is not possible to do it for every single person in America so relying on electronic questionnaires and other forms of filling the census are essential in the Bereau’s methods of collection.\n\n\n\nWhile we used the R file available to download to make the cleaned data set in our final project repository, we used the codebook to actually understand the data set R dataset file. The codebook contained information about each column and it was broken down into sections of self-administered substance abuse, imputed substance abuse, other self-administered sections, demographics, and geographic. We divided the sections and went through them, when sorting through the substance abuse sections, we stayed consistent in the types of columns we chose, those were: “age when first used”, “time since last used”, “number of days per week used in last 12 months”, and “best estimate of how many times used in last 30 days”.\nWhile the data set we are using from the 2021 NSDUH contains bountiful information concerning substance use, race, income, mental health, education, and age, it does not include very specific location information. The main information provided about the location of the survey respondents is stored in the variables “PDEN10” and “COUTYP4”. The PDEN10 variable represents “Population Density 2010” and respondents are sorted into coming from county based statistical areas (CBSAs) of 1 million or more people, less than 1 million people, or as not in a CBSA. The NSDUH survey designers created those classifications based on 2013 CBSA codes and 2010 Census data. They used the Census data to obtain the population counts for the different CBSA or non-CBSA areas. Although it was not available by the survey makers at the time, we decided to use 2020 Census data to provide a more up-to-date visualization of the populations of the three categories of the PDEN10 variable. This more closely reflects the county statuses at the time the survey data was collected in 2021. The COUNTYP4 variable sorts respondents based on rural urban continuum codes (RUCC) from 2013. It places respondents into large metro, small metro, or non-metro counties. To visualize these counties on a US map, we downloaded and cleaned an excel data file of the 2013 RUCC.\n\n\n\nThis is the link to the script, cleaning script. The Script cleans the data by keeping only the columns that have enough responses to the questions and also are highly relevant questions that can be used in understanding the data. Our strategy is too use the columns with the most value in analysis. Questions like “Have you ever smoked a cigarette” have high response rates and gives key insight into how we can associate drug/substance use with what we are trying to look into. The script filtering involved taking all the questions we deemed qualified to be included in and the rest of the 2,800 variables in this dataset to be filtered out and to keep a consistent set of questions for the analysis use. Such selecting looks like:\ndrug_health_data_clean_new &lt;- PUF2021_100622 |&gt;\n  select(QUESTID2, filedate,\n         cigever, cigage, mjever, mjage, alcever, cocever, cocage, crkever, crkage, herever, herage, UD5ILLANY, ... (other variables)\nThen we save the dataframe into a rds file for storage purposes and continue to the other datasets.\nFor the location analysis portion of our project, we used data from the 2020 Census, the 2009 CBSA, and the 2013 Rural Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC). To clean the CBSA data set, the readxl package was used to read the CBSA excel file. The data was already pretty clean, but in the original file there was a blank row and a few header rows, so we had to make sure to skip those. Then the column names were labeled and any missing values were converted to read as NA. A similar procedure was followed to read in an excel file containing Census data. With the Census data, we were interested in county populations by state.\nOne thing we had to consider with the Census data was that it contained a row at the start of each state where the county name and the state name were the same and this row listed the state’s total population. While we did not remove this row when cleaning the data set, we were aware of it and would filter it out if necessary. For example, it was not necessary to filter out this row when we created a merged CBSA/CENSUS dataset since we joined the datasets on the conditions that a pair of state and county names matched in both datasets and since the CBSA data did not have any such pairs, it would automatically be eliminated. This merged dataset would provide insight into the “PDEN10”, or Population Density 2010, variable, but we did not end up exploring that much further because we became more interested in how the metropolitan status of a county was related to drug use and this insight was provided by combining Census, CBSA, and RUCC data.\nWe ended up using the merged Census/CBSA data to find overlap between the Census and RUCC counties not only to stay true to the techniques of the survey designers, but also because the CBSA data provided FIPS codes of counties in the Census, and in the RUCC dataset counties were identified by their FIPS codes so this made the overlap easy. We then used this 3-way merged data set to create the map visualizing county metro status in the US.\nWe also had to download and use the ‘tigris’ package to make this map because we needed the shape files/geometries of the counties of interest. Tigris is an R package that grants you access to the shape files of counties or states based on US Census data. We took advantage of the counties() function within tigris to pull county geometries and then combined them with lists of large, small, and non-metro counties we had made based on the Census, CBSA, and RUCC data sets. With that information, we were able to make a US map that shaded the US counties by metro status.\nOne important thing that we had to look into when cleaning the CBSA, CENSUS, and RUCC data sets was the column types since they were all excel files. We tried using the character() function to tell us the types of columns we were dealing with to pass into the read_excel() function. However, we still ran into parsing errors because the excel files had numeric values stored as texts. To address this issue, we used a feature of read_excel() that allowed us to pass in a column type called “guess”, allowing R to guess at/decide on how it wanted to read in the numeric values stored as text which fixed the error message and produced readable data. Once this error had been fixed, we were able to save the cleaned CBSA, Census, and RUCC data sets as RDS files."
