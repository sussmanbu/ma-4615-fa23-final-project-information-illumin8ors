This comes from the file `analysis.qmd`.

We describe here our detailed data analysis.
This page will provide an overview of what questions you hope to ask, illustrations relevant aspects of the data with tables and figures, and a statistical model that attempts to answer part of the question.
You'll also reflect on next steps and further analysis.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
print(getwd())
data <- read_csv(here::here("dataset/loan_refusal_clean.csv"))
load(here::here("dataset/loan_refusal.RData"))
print(ls())
```

In general, you should try to provide links to relevant resources, especially those that helped you. You don't have to link to every StackOverflow post you used but if there are explainers on aspects of the data or specific models that you found helpful, try to link to those. Also, try to link to other sources that might support (or refute) your analysis. These can just be regular hyperlinks. You don't need a formal citation.

## Logisitic Regression on Cigeratte Use and Race

```{r}
# Filtering the model such that we have binary values
log_mod <- cleaned_data |>
  select(NEWRACE2, cigtry, cigrec) |>
  filter(cigtry < 984 | cigtry == 991) |>
  mutate(cigtry = ifelse(cigtry == 991, 0, cigtry)) |>
  mutate(cigrec = ifelse(cigrec == 91, 0, cigrec)) |>
  mutate(cigtry_binary = ifelse(cigtry > 0, 1, 0))

# Creating Logistic Regression model
model <- glm(cigtry_binary ~ NEWRACE2, data = log_mod, family = "binomial")

odds_ratios <- exp(coef(model))

summary(model)

odds_ratios_df <- data.frame(
  Race_Category = ifelse(names(odds_ratios) == "(Intercept)", "Hispanic",
                     ifelse(names(odds_ratios) == "NEWRACE2NonHisp Asian", "Asian",
                     ifelse(names(odds_ratios) == "NEWRACE2NonHisp Black/Afr Am", "Black/Afr Am",
                     ifelse(names(odds_ratios) == "NEWRACE2NonHisp more than one race", "NonHisp more than one race",
                     ifelse(names(odds_ratios) == "NEWRACE2NonHisp Native Am/AK Native", "Native Am/AK Native",
                     ifelse(names(odds_ratios) == "NEWRACE2NonHisp Native HI/Other Pac Isl", "Native HI/Other Pac Isl",
                     ifelse(names(odds_ratios) == "NEWRACE2NonHisp White", "White", names(odds_ratios)))))))),
  Odds_Ratio = odds_ratios
)

odds_ratios_df
```
	The coefficient for the intercept/Hispanic population shows that when all other variables are being held constant, the log odds for Hispanic population is  -0.70059. This is just in a sense the baseline to compare to the other races. For the Asian population of this dataset, when converting the log odds to odd ratio, the odds of an Asian population smoking cigarettes is 0.6482 times the odds of Hispanics smoking cigarettes. This means that the odds of the Asian population smoking cigarettes is lower than the Hispanic population. In terms of the numbers from the model, White people in the dataset have 1.9676 times the odds of smoking cigarettes compared to Hispanics.

## Rubric: On this page

You will


* Introduce what motivates your Data Analysis (DA)
  * Which variables and relationships are you most interested in?
  * What questions are you interested in answering?
  * Provide context for the rest of the page. This will include figures/tables that illustrate aspects of the data of your question.
* Modeling and Inference 
  * The page will include some kind of formal statistical model. This could be a linear regression, logistic regression, or another modeling framework.
  * Explain the techniques you used for validating your results.
  * Describe the results of your modelling and make sure to give a sense of the uncertainty in your estimates and conclusions.
* Explain the flaws and limitations of your analysis
  * Are there some assumptions that you needed to make that might not hold? Is there other data that would help to answer your questions?
* Clarity Figures
  * Are your figures/tables/results easy to read, informative, without problems like overplotting, hard-to-read labels, etc?
  * Each figure should provide a key insight. Too many figures or other data summaries can detract from this. (While not a hard limit, around 5 total figures is probably a good target.)
  * Default `lm` output and plots are typically not acceptable.
* Clarity of Explanations
  * How well do you explain each figure/result?
  * Do you provide interpretations that suggest further analysis or explanations for observed phenomenon?
* Organization and cleanliness.
  * Make sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code, organize with sections or multiple pages, use bullets, etc.
  * This page should be self-contained.
