# Early Insights
## Motivation for Data Analysis (DA)

Our motivation for engaging in Data Analysis of the NSDUH survey comes from our shared interest in finding out how drug use affects all areas of life in society. Understanding more about drug use is important because so much is unknown about drug use and being able to uncover certain relationships may be key in understanding and addressing drug use. For us we are super excited to explore such a huge dataset such as the NSDUH because we can take our time to explore the small key relationships between so many different variables throughout the dataset. Navigating through such a dataset took us a long time to find variables that we needed for analysis but it was perfect in the end because we were able to effectively show key relationships that help the general public understand more about drugs and their use. 

Ultimately our goal is to provide key insights into how certain factors play a role in a personâ€™s drug use even if they did a drug for one time. We were initially interested in finding out just about how race and drug use is affecting one another but we then soon realized that we also need to explore the factors for drug use and not just the relationship between the two. We then realized that a more holistic view of each factor into drug use would be more appropriate. These factors of income,and location can play a role in how drug use and race correlate and associate together.

## Interested Variables

The variables we were highly interested in exploring is the relationship between drugs used and the race of the respondent in this survey. Being able to see the variables that factor into the relationship is important to understand how a person might be influenced to try and do drugs. The most important variables and factors help determine not only such a relationship of race and drug use but also the disparities between racial groups and drug use. 

Going even further, we want to see what factors attribute to drug use in any way, that being income or location. These are important relationships to explore because it could provide insight into why or how someone could be introduced to drug use and what factors play a role. Some specific questions from the survey that play into our analysis are questions asking if a person has ever done such a drug and such a drug could be one of the 6 we are exploring which are cigarettes, marijuana, alcohol, cocaine, crack, heroine. Many factors could influence drug use such that two factors are reliant on each other. For example there could be relationships such that a young person with low income may or may not be more inclined to use drugs. These claims can only be made after such analysis of this dataset and its important to explore them. We aim to answer these questions and relationships below in the analysis.

Also at what age each person has done any of the respective substances and whether they continue to do those drugs or not. Income, age and location are also important factors when it comes to finding the factors as these can be associated with higher drug use or lower as well. We want to explore relationships like if you are younger will you be trying more drugs or will you try more drugs when you are older and how does the racial group aspect play a role. Age can also play along with income and location and it's important to explore whether these factors intertwine with each other or are they stand alone. We aim to answer these questions and relationships below in the analysis.


## Questions for Analysis

The key question we are trying to answer is firstly how does race affect the drug use of a person. Going further, how does location, age, and income factor into this relationship.

## Logisitic Regression Models

Important to note that the baselines/intercepts are the Asian Population

### Substance Use with Race
```{r}

# Model for the Substance Use vs Race 
model_sub <- glm(drug_use ~ NEWRACE2, data = drug_use_with_race, family = "binomial")

tidy_output <- tidy(model_sub)|>
  mutate(term = ifelse(term == "(Intercept)", "Asian", str_replace(term, "NEWRACE2", "")))

conf_intervals <- confint(model_sub)

odds_ratios <- exp(coef(model_sub))

odds_ratios_df <- data.frame(
  Odds_Ratio = odds_ratios
)

output_table <- cbind(tidy_output, conf_intervals,odds_ratios_df) |>
  rename(Race = term) |>
  select(-statistic,-std.error) |>
  rownames_to_column(var = "RowNames") |>
  select(-RowNames)

output_table
```



### Substance Use with Race and Income as a Factor of Each Other 

We are gonna assume for the model here that the hypothesis is that there is no association between likelihood of trying drugs ever and race group as well as Income.

```{r}
drug_use_with_race <- cleaned_data |>
  select(NEWRACE2, cigever, cigage, mjever, mjage, alcever, cocever, cocage, crkever, crkage, herever, herage, income, COUTYP4) |>
  mutate(drug_use = ifelse(cigever==1 | mjever==1 | alcever==1 | cocever==1 | crkever==1 | herever==1, 1, 0))

# Model for the Substance Use vs Race and Income being Independent
model_sub <- glm(drug_use ~ NEWRACE2 + factor(income), data = drug_use_with_race, family = "binomial")

tidy_output <- tidy(model_sub)|>
  mutate(term = ifelse(term == "(Intercept)", "Asian", str_replace(term, "NEWRACE2", "")))

conf_intervals <- confint(model_sub)

odds_ratios <- exp(coef(model_sub))

odds_ratios_df <- data.frame(
  Odds_Ratio = odds_ratios
)

output_table <- cbind(tidy_output, conf_intervals,odds_ratios_df) |>
  rename(Race = term) |>
  select(-statistic,-std.error) |>
  rownames_to_column(var = "RowNames") |>
  select(-RowNames)

output_table
```


### Substance Use with Race and Income as a Factor of Each Other 

Same as before, we are gonna assume for the model here that the hypothesis is that there is no association between likelihood of trying drugs ever and race group as well as Income.
```{r}
# Model for the Substance Use vs Race and Income
model_sub_income <- glm(drug_use ~ NEWRACE2*factor(income), data = drug_use_with_race, family = "binomial")

tidy_output_income <- tidy(model_sub_income)|>
  mutate(term = ifelse(term == "(Intercept)", "Asian", str_replace(term, "NEWRACE2", "")))

conf_intervals_income <- confint(model_sub_income)

odds_ratios_income <- exp(coef(model_sub_income))

output_table <- cbind(tidy_output_income,conf_intervals_income, odds_ratios_income) |>
  select(-statistic,-std.error) |>
  rownames_to_column(var = "RowNames") |>
  select(-RowNames)

output_table
```


### Substance Use with Race and Location

```{r}
# Model for the Substance Use vs Race and Location Independent
model_sub_loc <- glm(drug_use ~ NEWRACE2+factor(COUTYP4), data = drug_use_with_race, family = "binomial")

tidy_output_loc <- tidy(model_sub_loc)|>
  mutate(term = ifelse(term == "(Intercept)", "Asian", str_replace(term, "NEWRACE2", "")))

conf_intervals_loc <- confint(model_sub_loc)

odds_ratios_loc <- exp(coef(model_sub_loc))

output_table <- cbind(tidy_output_loc,conf_intervals_loc, odds_ratios_loc) |>
  select(-statistic,-std.error) |>
  rownames_to_column(var = "RowNames") |>
  select(-RowNames)

output_table
```

### Substance Use with Race and Location as a Factor of Each Other 
```{r}
# Model for the Substance Use vs Race and Location
model_sub_loc <- glm(drug_use ~ NEWRACE2*factor(COUTYP4), data = drug_use_with_race, family = "binomial")

tidy_output_loc <- tidy(model_sub_loc)|>
  mutate(term = ifelse(term == "(Intercept)", "Asian", str_replace(term, "NEWRACE2", "")))

conf_intervals_loc <- confint(model_sub_loc)

odds_ratios_loc <- exp(coef(model_sub_loc))

output_table <- cbind(tidy_output_loc,conf_intervals_loc, odds_ratios_loc) |>
  select(-statistic,-std.error) |>
  rownames_to_column(var = "RowNames") |>
  select(-RowNames)

output_table
```


## Testing the plot of location with substance use

``` {r}
metro_test <- cleaned_data |>
  filter(CIG30AV < 94) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = CIG30AVG)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = NEWRACE2)) + facet_wrap(vars(COUTYP4))

```

``` {r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tigris)

counties = counties(cb = TRUE)

counties %>% filter(STUSPS != "AK", STUSPS != "HI", STUSPS != "MP", STUSPS != "AS", STUSPS != "PR", STUSPS != "GU") %>% ggplot() + geom_sf()

## Limitations of Analysis

In our analysis of the data, there were a few limitations that we had to keep in mind. The first is that both when conducting and reading the analysis, remember that the results on substance use are based on respondentâ€™s memories so that introduces error because people may have falsely reported their true substance use. Another source of error that we had to address was that the results of our plots were pretty skewed because the number of white respondents was much higher than the number of respondents of other race categories. This was falsely making it look like substance use was much higher for the white race category than it was for others. To address this, we tried using proportions instead.
